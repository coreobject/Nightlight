# Nightlight

## Description

Create an interactive night light. At minimum it will turn on in the dark and off in the light. A touch sensor will allow the user to turn the lights on or off manually. Use an Arduino with 6 LEDs, a photoresistor, and a capacitive sensor. Consider the night light as a complete object. What will be its environment? Who will use it? How will it be used? What does it look like and why?

Design Criteria:
 + Appearance
 + Construction
 + Interactivity / usability
